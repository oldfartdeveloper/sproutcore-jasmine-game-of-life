Project:   Life
=============================================================================

Gregory Moeck, Brandon Murphy, James Gary, and Scott Smith (OldFartDeveloper) sat down
to BDD the "Game of Life" using SproutCore and Jasmine.

At the end of the evening, this is what they had.  OldFarDeveloper uploaded it
so people could continue if desired.

This has Jasmine integrated into the SproutCore project instead of QUnit.

If you launch the app using http://localhost:4020, this is listed under 'life'.  Right now all you
get is a vertical column of 10 white squares.
